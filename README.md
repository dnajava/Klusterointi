# Klusterointi

This program is not a ready project. It's on the way to finish. It is programmed with pyCharm.

The program makes from a set of FTDNA kit mt-dna matchlists (all in same haplogroup) clusters network. Every cluster is
sub haplogroup to oritinal haplogroup. It makes nodes.csv and links.csv to Gephi. Gephi can display a network of mt-dna matches
in one haplogroup. The match clusters can be subgroups to that haplogroup. Grouping depends on GD values between
matches. 

This is the main purpose to this program. You can do other things with this program too. Be free to modify code.
If you think you know better methods to do something, feel free to contact and tell to Ilpo at ilpo@iki.fi.

This caught interest when I told it to people. April 2018 the project stopped.
And in yuear 2021 I tired to continue project. But it was not a succee. Autumn 2025 I tried AI and this was succee.

Graphical GUI added October 2025. It works in my Kubuntu KDE 25.04 system.

TODO:

- Split the cluster, if it contains matches which have other matches than common matches in that cluster.
- Fork to working with y-dna
